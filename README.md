# pwsim2
Another pro wrestling sim but using django+react+tailwind, made for practice

## Prerequisites

- Python (version 3+) & Pip
- Django (version 16+)
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation, Configuration and Usage

Please refer to the README in the frontend and backend directories for specific installation and usage instructions

## What is this

A very very basic web app full stack frontend+backend that allows common CRUD operations over pro-wrestlers.

It is very much a way for me to experiment and learn different technologies.

Frontend styling is mostly (if not all) powered by TailwindCSS.
